# Go with tests - Jakub Pazio

My try at [Learn Go with tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests) Test Driven Development course of Go programming language

## Chapters progress 

I'm not planning to do 100% of them. This list is made just to stimulate dopamine in my brain

- [x] Install Go
- [x] Hello World
- [x] Integers
- [x] Iteration
- [x] Arrays and slices
- [ ] Structs, methods & interfaces
- [ ] Pointers & errors
- [ ] Maps
- [ ] Dependency Injection
- [ ] Mocking
- [ ] Concurrency
- [ ] Select
- [ ] Reflection
- [ ] Sync
- [ ] Context
- [ ] Intro to property based tests
- [ ] Maths
- [ ] Reading files
- [ ] Templating
- [ ] Generics
- [ ] Revisiting arrays and slices with generics

## My Rules

- Never copy anything
- For every chapter write short notes on things i wish to use in future or found interesting/controversial
- Write own set of test and try to play with every example
- Update personal Go notes for each foreign concept
